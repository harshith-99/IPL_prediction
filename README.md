# IPL_prediction
This project predicts the outcome of IPL matches using machine learning algorithms, trained on historical data from 2008 onward. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and multiple classification models to determine the likely winner based on team matchups, toss decisions, and team performance.
